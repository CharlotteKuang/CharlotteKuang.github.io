Somebody once asked Warren Buffett about his secret to success. Buffett pointed to a stack of books and said,

> Read 500 pages like this every day. That's how knowledge works. It builds up, like compound interest. All of you can do it, but I guarantee not many of you will...

从前有人问[華倫·巴菲特](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-hant/%E6%B2%83%E4%BC%A6%C2%B7%E5%B7%B4%E8%8F%B2%E7%89%B9) 关于他成功的秘密。巴菲特指着一叠书说到：“

> 每天从这堆书中读500页。这就是知识的力量。它是一个日积月累的过程，就像银行存款的利息一样。所有人都可以做到，但我保证，不多的人会做到……

”

When I first found this quote of Buffett's two years ago, something was wrong.

当两年前我注意到巴菲特这句话的时候，我觉得我的生活有点不对劲。

It was Dec. 2014. I'd found my dream job. Some days, I would be there, sitting at my dream job, and I would think, "My god what if I'm still here in 40 years? I don't want to die like this..."

那是2014年的12月。我已经找到我理想的工作。过了一段日子后，我会坐在我理想的工作岗位上，我会去想“天啊，如果我未来的40年都在这里工作的话，那么我不想到我死的那天也是这样。”

Something wasn't right. I'd followed the prescription. Good grades. Leadership. Recommendations. College. Dream Job. I was a winner. I'd finished the race. Here I was in the land of dreams. But something was terribly, terribly wrong.

有些事不对劲。我已经遵循者所谓的“人生的正确道路”：成绩好、有领导能力、有出色的推荐信、大学、好工作。我是一个人生赢家。我已经完成了人生的竞赛了。现在我生活在一个梦幻的世界里。但有些事错的非常非常离谱。

Every day, from my dream job desk, I looked out into their eyes. Empty, empty eyes.

每一天，我从我的工位看过去，我看到了我的同事的眼睛，空洞迷茫的眼神。

There were no answers.

我找不到问题的答案。

In January of 2015, I found Buffett's quote. I decided to read. I was going to read and read and read and never stop until I got some damn answers.

在2015年一月，我看到了巴菲特的名言。我决定去阅读。我决定去坚持阅读，一直读到我找到问题的答案位置。

I didn't quite make 500 pages a day, but, in these last two years, I've read over 400 books cover to cover. That decision to start reading was one of the most important decisions in my life. 

我没做到每天阅读500页的书籍，但是在这两年里，我阅读过超过400本数据，从头到尾。这个阅读的决定是我人生中最重要的决定之一。

Books gave me the courage to travel. Books gave me the conviction to quit my job. Books gave me role models and heroes and meaning in the world where I had none.

书籍给了我去旅行的勇气；书籍给了我辞职的信心；书籍给了我榜样、在这个世界上的意义，这都是我以前从来都没有的。

I want to say reading 200 books a year is an amazing thing. But the truth is, it's not. Anybody can do it.

我想说的是，每年阅读200本书是一件了不起的事。然而，事实上这并不是。因为任何人都可以做到。

All it takes is some simple math and the right tools.

这一切只是一些简单的数据计算和正确的工具罢了。

1.Do not quit before you start
------------------------

1.不要未开始就放弃
------------------------

When average Joe hears the advice "Read 500 pages like this every day," his snap reaction is to say, "No way! That's impossible!"

当一个普通人Joe听到“每天阅读500页”的建议时，他立马的反应就是“不可能，这绝对做不到！”。

Joe will then go on to make up reasons to justify his belief without doing any deep thinking at all These might include "I'm too busy," "I'm not smart enough," or "Books just aren't for me."

Joe或许会编造以下原因来在证明这件事的不可能性，并不会去深入的思考。比如“我太忙了”、“我不够聪明”或者是“书籍不适合我”。

But what if we go a little deeper? For example, what does it actually take to read 200 books a year? Two years ago, I stopped to do the simple math. Here's what I found: Reading 200 books a year isn't hard at all.

但如果我们再深入一点来思索。比如说，一年读200本书籍到底需要做些什么？两年前，我停下来做了些简单的计算。这是我的发现：一年200本书籍根本不是一件难事。

It's just like Buffett says. Anyone can do it, but most people won't.

就像巴菲特所说的，所有人都可以做到，只是大部分人不会做。

2.Do the simple math
------------------------

2.做道简单的算术题
------------------------

How much time does it take to read 200 books a year?

一年读200本书籍，需要花多少时间呢？

First, let's look at two quick statistics:

* The average American reads 200-400 words per minute (Since you're on Medium, I'm going to assume you read 400 wpm like me)
* Typical non-fiction books have ~50,000 words

首先让我们看两个统计数据：

* 一个美国人平均一分钟阅读200-400个单词（既然你是一个普通人，那么我认为你跟我一样，每分钟阅读400个单词）。
* 通常一本非小说的书籍大约是50000个单词。

Now, all we need are some quick calculations...

现在我们只需做些简单的计算：

* 200 books * 50,000 words/book = 10 million words
* 10 million words / 400 wpm = 25,000 minutes
* 25,000 minutes / 60 = 417 hours

* 200 本书 * 50000单词/书 = 1千万单词
* 1千万单词 / 400 单词每分钟 = 25000分钟
* 25000分钟 / 60 = 417小时

That's all there is to it. **To read 200 books, simply spend 417 hours a year reading**.

这就是其中的奥妙。**如果要阅读200本书籍，那么只需每年花417小时**。

I know, I know. If your brain is like mine, it probably saw "417 hours" and immediately tried to shut off. Most people only work 40 hours a week! How can we possibly read for 417 hours?

我知道。如果你的脑子和我的一样的话，那么当你的脑子处理“417小时”，你的脑子一定会立马选择逃避这个信息。很多人每周才工作40小时！我们怎么可能画417小时在阅读上呢？

Don't let your monkey brain turn you away yet. Let's do a quick reframe for what 417 hours really means...

不要让你的木鱼脑袋把你吓跑了。我们先对417小时重新做一个定义。

3.Find the time
------------------------

3.挤出些时间
------------------------

Wowsers, 417 hours. That sure feels like a lot. But what does 417 hours really mean? Let's try to get some more perspective.

哇，417 小时！这看起来吓人。可是417小时真正意味着什么呢？让我们从多个角度看这个问题。

Here's how much time a single American spends on social media and TV in a year.

* 608 hours on social media
* 1642 hours on TV

* 608小时花在社交媒体。
* 1642小时花在电视节目。

Wow. That's 2250 hours a year spent on TRASH. If those hours were spent reading instead, **you could be reading over 1,000 books a year!**

哇！每年浪费2250小时在*垃圾*上。如果这些时间花在阅读上，那么**你每年可以阅读超过1000本书籍！**

Here's the simple truth behind reading a lot of books:It's not that hard. We have all the time we need. The scary part--the part we all ignore--is that we are too addicted , too weak, and too distracted to do what we all know is important...

这就是隐藏在大量阅读背后的真相：这不是一件难的事情呢。我们有充足的时间。但是可怕的部分，正是我们忽略的部分，便是我们太被其他的事吸引、意志太脆弱、太容易失去注意来做我们都知道很重要的事。

All it takes to start reading a lot more is to take "empty time" spent Twitter-stalking celebrities or watching Desperate Housewives and convert some of it to reading time.

只需要将我们花在跟踪名人在推特上的状态或者看《绝望的主妇》的时间的一部分转而去阅读，我们就能更接近我们的目标。

The theory is simple. It's the execution that's hard.

理论很简单，真正难的在于执行。


4.Execute
------------------------

4.执行
------------------------

We all know reading is important. We all know we should do more of it. But we don't. The main reason this happens is a failure to execute.

我们都知道阅读很重要。我们都知道我们需要大量的阅读。但我们不行动。是因为我们缺乏行动力。

I'm not so perfect at it yet, but here are some tactics that have helped me get results.

我在这方面（指行动）不是那么完美，但是我还是可以给出一些能够帮助自己行动起来去阅读的策略。

*Use environmental design*

*利用环境因素*

If you were quitting cocaine, would you keep it lying around the house? Of course not. Media is designed to be addictive. Moving away from media addiction can be as difficult as quitting drugs.

如果你正在戒掉可卡因（一种毒品），你会让自己成天躺在家里吗？当然不会。媒体本质上就是可让人上瘾的。摆脱对媒体的成瘾就像戒掉吸毒一样困难。

The biggest bang-for buck changes here are environmental.

这最大的秘诀就在于环境的作用。

If you want to read, make sure you remove all distractions from your environment and you make books as easy to access as possible.

如果你想阅读，那么首先确保你把身边的干扰从你所处的环境中清除掉，并且你尽可能的让自己很容易就接触到书籍。


*Upload habits*

*上升到习惯*

Willpower is not a good tool for lifestyle change. It always fails you when you need it most. Instead of relying on strength of mind, build a fortress of habits--these are what will keep you resilient in tough times.

意志力并不是执行改变很好的工具。它总在你最需要它的时候掉链子。建立一个习惯的堡垒，而不是依靠意志，这样当你陷入困难时，你会变得更见有韧性。

If you're not familiar with habit science, my favorite book on the subject is Tynan's Superhuman by Habit. It;s infinitely practical, and practical is all I care about.

如果你还不了解习惯科学的话，我最喜欢的书是Tynan的《Superhuman by Habit》。这真是一本实用的书籍，而实用性正是我最关心的。


*Go multi-medium*

*随时随地的阅读*

When it comes to reading, be a jack of all trades, not a specialist.

当涉及到阅读事，尽可能全盘接受，而不是去挑剔。

If your goal is to read more, you can't be picky about where you read or what mediums you use. I read paper books. I read on my phone. I listen to audio-books. And I do thse things everywhere--on park benches, in buses, in the toilet...Wherever I can.

如果你的目标是多读书，那么你一定不能对你在哪阅读、用什么来阅读挑剔。我读纸质书籍。我用我的手机阅读。我听语音书籍。我在任何地方都可以阅读--在公园的长椅，在公交上，在厕所里头，哪里都可以。

Make your reading opportunistic. If you have a chance, take it. If you don't have a chance, find one.

让你阅读变得简单。如果你有机会，那么就阅读。如果没有，找个机会来阅读。
