=====================

Hi, my name is charlotte

This is a paragraph. Each paragraph is separated from each other by a blank line which contains nothing or only contains tab or space.

> this is a quote.

This is a line with some *emphasized*!

Another type of **emphasized**

List1:

* Apple
* Orange
* Booze

List2:

1. Mother 
2. Father
3. Sister

This is a [link](https://www.baidu.com)

I get 10 times more traffic from [Google][1] than from
[Yahoo][2] or [MSN][3].

I strongly recommend against using any `<blink>` tags.

I wish SmartyPants used named entities like `&mdash;`
instead of decimal-encoded entites like `&#8212;`.

{% highlight python %}
def main():
    a = [1,2,3]
    print a
{% endhighlight %}
